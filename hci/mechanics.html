                        DOTO 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena video game developed and published by valve. Doto 2 is played in matches between two teams that aims to protect their respective ancients, the dire and radiant. Each teams consists of five players, and each players independently controls their own character, known as a “hero” who all have unique abilities and different styles of play. During a match, heroes collect experience points, and gold through eliminating other heroes, or creeps that infinitely spawn on the three lanes. The higher experience points they have, the stronger a hero becomes. The Gold that has been earned could be spent on items that further enhances their abilities. The ultimate objective of the game is to destroy the opposing team’s ancient. The team that manages to accomplish this feat first, will achieve victory over their opponents.

                        Controls in Doto 2 are mainly done by mouse movements to move the camera and giving orders for units to move, while keypresses are used to activate hero abilities. To move the camera players can simply move the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen. To choose a unit, players can left click on the unit, and then to move the selected unit players can right click on any location on the map. Doing this will move the hero to the clicked spot. If the right click is done on an enemy unit, instead of moving, the unit given the command will attempt to attack the right clicked unit.

                        To select several units at once, players can click, hold, and drag to create a box, to select several units at once. Issuing commands such as move by right clicking will order all the selected units to do the commands together. To use abilities, players can use the buttons Q W E and R for hero abilities.
